# Fix your atom-fuzzy-grep for Atom!

## Make sure your path is correct

Currently my path is `/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom`, but if yours isn't, change it immediately.

## Then just run it in the folder you pulled it into

```
ruby AtomGrepFix.rb
```

## Then restart Atom

```
atom .
```

## Now grepping should work!
